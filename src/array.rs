//! Drop-in replacement for builtin `[T; N]` arrays, using [`Uint`] for the length

//! TODO: Examples
//!
//! # Oversized arrays
//! Because [`Uint`] is not restricted to the values of a [`usize`], it is possible to have array
//! types that have a [`Length`] exceeding [`usize::MAX`]. These arrays can only exist when the
//! item type is zero-sized, as they would otherwise exceed the object size limit of [`isize::MAX`].
//!
//! While these arrays can exist, they are only partially supported and many methods/impls will panic
//! when interacting with them. These methods/impls have a line in their documentation stating that
//! oversized arrays are unsupported.
//!
//! Note that this includes methods/impls that are usually considered infallible, such as
//! [`Deref::deref`](core::ops::Deref).
//!
//! [`Uint`]: crate::Uint
//! [`Length`]: Array::Length

/// Trait for arrays whose length is measured as a [`Uint`](crate::Uint).
///
/// # Safety
/// Currently, this trait is sealed.
///
/// The guarantees made by types implementing [`Array`] with `Item = T` and `Length = N` include the following:
/// - Must have the same layout as an equivalent `[T; N]` builtin array. If `N > usize::MAX` (only
///   relevant for ZSTs), they still act as if there was such an array type.
/// - Arrays have no additional safety requirements over builtin arrays whatsoever. In particular:
///     - They have the same semantics as the equivalent builtin array with respect to arbitrary auto traits,
///       assuming there is no manual implementation from the crate declaring the trait.
///     - They also have the same semantics as the equivalent builtin array with respect to drop glue.
///       They never have a [`Drop`] implementation and only have the drop glue from their item type.
///       When the array is dropped, exactly `N` instances of `T` are dropped
///       ([in order](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/destructors.html)), even if `N > usize::MAX`.
///     - Note that together with the point about the layout, this is sufficient to perform arbitrary
///       casts and transmutes between equivalent array types. See the [`convert`] module.
/// - `MaybeUninit<[T; N]>` and `[MaybeUninit<T>; N]` are considered equivalent for the purposes of
///   this trait.
/// - Arrays of arrays are equivalent to their flattened versions, e.g. `[[i32; 4]; 3]` is
///   equivalent to `[i32; 12]`, which is equivalent to `[[i32; 3]; 4]`.
